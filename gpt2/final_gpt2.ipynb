It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.

Compare Peter Pans flight power which is also powered by happy thoughts. Conversely thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors down to earth again.

The remains NMMNH P-18400 consist of a tibia vertebrae and fragments and came from the ?late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation near Fort Wingate. Andrew Heckert in his unpublished thesis proposed the name Cinizasaurus hunti for the specimen but the name was never adopted and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs Nesbitt Irmis and Parker 2007. In the redescription the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada. To date three species have been described the type species S. goodwini from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation Late Campanian of San Juan County New Mexico USA S. buchholtzae from the Hell Creek Formation Late Maastrichtian of western Carter County Montana USA and S. edmontonense from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta Canada. The etymology of Sphaerotholus is a combination of the Greek sphaira meaning ball and tholos meaning dome and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull. The survival of Sphaerotholus from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration approximately 7-8\\xa0million years and a widespread distribution. Williamson and Carr who first described the genus in 2002 diagnose it as follows Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.

It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons a people of Celtic language and custom. It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain. Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing. The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago. Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales or Cymru in Welsh at least 230000 years ago while Homo sapiens arrived by about 31000 BC. However continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic Neolithic and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age the region like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language. The Romans who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43 first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79. The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion. Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter and several distinct groups formed. The Welsh people were the largest of these groups and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century.'],\n",

Along with David Life she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products vegan as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or emptiness which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon How you treat others will determine how others treat you.

For Bergson reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis which he said implies that we go around an object gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative. Instead reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition which Bergson expressed as entering into the object. Duration French la durée is a theory of time and consciousness posited by the French philosopher Henri Bergson. Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer due he believed to Spencers lack of comprehension of mechanics which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science. Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment it would be gone one measures an immobile complete line whereas time is mobile and incomplete. For the individual time may speed up or slow down whereas for science it would remain the same. Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man which is a kind of duration neither a unity nor a quantitative multiplicity. Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture. It can only be grasped through a simple intuition of the imagination.'],\n",

They are believed to have been used for hunting wild animals and consist of long dry-stone walls converging on a neck which opens into a confined space which was used as the killing floor. The length of the walls can run to hundreds of metres and can be best seen from the air. They were given their name by pilots who first saw them from the air in the 1920s. Almost 2000 have been identified across Jordan and Syria. No research has been done across the Saudi Arabian Desert. Modern research has proven that the desert kites were mainly used for hunting herds of migrating goitered or Persian gazelle a species which became extinct in Southern Levant during the 19th century. Most desert kites have been dated through scientific methods to be between 3 and 5 thousand years old. The claim of older ages 8 to 9 thousand years has been contradicted by more recent studies. Younger dates mean that the mass hunting did not occur in prehistory and was not done by hunter-gatherers but during a later period by agriculturalists who were already growing most of their food. Rock art in the vicinity of some of the kites indicates that the hunt could represent a large social effort done together by people from several settlements and showing religious connotations.'],\n",

This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries. During the steamboat era on the Missouri River when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west.

Under the Constitution of Virginia this original interim appointment was to expire thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly unless the legislature elected her to a full twelve-year term. On August 17 2015 the General Assembly convened in special session but failed to elect anyone to the full twelve-year term before the Senate of Virginia purported to adjourn sine die. The Constitution prohibits one chamber of the legislature from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber. The Governor claims that this provision applies only to regular sessions of the General Assembly the House of Delegates and most Senate Republicans claim it applies to special sessions as well and that the Senates adjournment was invalid because the House did not consent. Because there is legal uncertainty about whether the legislature was still in session it is unclear whether the governor could fill the vacancy created when Justice Roushs original interim appointment expired on September 16 2015. Nevertheless the governor announced his view that the legislature was not in session and purported to reappoint her for a second interim term. Whether this second interim appointment was valid or invalid has not been determined. If valid the second interim appointment expired on February 12 2016 thirty days after the regular session of the General Assembly began on January 13 because the legislature did not elect her to a full twelve-year term.

The program was originally established as an effort to raise awareness of the Government of Canadas contributions to Quebec industries and other activities in order to counter the actions of the Parti Québécois government of the province that worked to promote Quebec independence. Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris 1763 which ceded New France of which Canada was a part to the British Empire. Gradually other territories colonies and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada. Later with Confederation in 1867 the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada which was subsequently divided into four provinces Ontario Quebec New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. A number of other British colonies such as Newfoundland and British Columbia and large territories such as Ruperts Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation. Over time the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949. Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canadas final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.'],\n",

In 1914 the division was raised as the 43rd Division of Herbert Kitcheners New Army and was originally intended to form part of a 50000-strong Welsh Army Corps that had been championed by David Lloyd George the assignment of Welsh recruits to other formations meant that this concept was never realised. The 43rd was renamed the 38th Welsh Division on 29 April 1915 and shipped to France later that year. It arrived in France with a poor reputation seen as a political formation that was ill-trained and poorly led. The divisions baptism by fire came in the first days of the Battle of the Somme where it captured the strongly held Mametz Wood at the loss of nearly 4000 men. This strongly held German position needed to be secured in order to facilitate the next phase of the Somme offensive the Battle of Bazentin Ridge. Despite securing its objective the divisions reputation was adversely affected by miscommunication among senior officers. For example consider the phrase The 43rd President of the United States of America while the 43rd President of the United States is actually George W. Bush things might have been different. Bush might have lost the election meaning that the 43rd President might have been Al Gore or Ralph Nader instead. How remote these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for physics and counterfactualism. The 43rd President of the United States of America is thus a non-rigid designator picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds Al Gore in others and yet other people in other worlds.'],\n",

Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement. At the dawn of the media age the newspaper popular magazines like Life and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination. After its creation the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends not just by celebrities but by the average person. The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news perspectives and communication. Magazines are still popular but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal whether personal or commercial which might detail someones experience in a new restaurant a purchased item of clothing or knickknack or a review to a film.

Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege have both been associated with the descriptivist theory which is sometimes called the Frege–Russell theory. In the philosophy of language a proper name for example the names of persons or places is a name which is ordinarily taken to uniquely identify its referent in the world. As such it presents particular challenges for theories of meaning and it has become a central problem in analytical philosophy. The common sense view was originally formulated by John Stuart Mill in A System of Logic where he defines it as a word that answers the purpose of showing what thing it is that we are talking about but not of telling anything about it. This view was criticized when philosophers applied principles of formal logic to linguistic propositions. Gottlob Frege pointed out that proper names may apply to imaginary and inexistent entities without becoming meaningless and he showed that sometimes more than one proper name may identify the same entity without having the same sense so that the phrase Homer believed the morning star was the evening star could be meaningful and not tautological in spite of the fact that the morning star and the evening star identifies the same referent. This example became known as Freges Puzzle and is a central issue in the theory of proper names.'],\n",

Each team enters a Regional Qualifying Round Final where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example Spain would face Yugoslavia an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player beats the opponent it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For example Mexico would face the Netherlands Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup kits again to reflect the World Cup and players to resemble squads from the World Cup teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers.

In 2010 the latter section was further extended to reach Junction Road. In summer 2011 work began at Robertsbridge to extend further eastwards to Northbridge Street which entailed the rebuilding of five bridges. By June 2012 this further extension was also completed. In September 2013 a Gala weekend at Robertsbridge marked the progress to date and the start of the next phase - the re-instatement of the section between Northbridge Street and Junction Road for which statutory permissions are being sought.
